1. Hello! This is my pre-work project for Code the Dream using the coffee API.
2. I wasn't able to figure out the Javascrip but I wanted to make a coffee shop menu that allowed the user to switch between the iced and hot drink menus.
3. I used Github to deploy my website and it can be found here:  https://sxcueto.github.io/CTD-preWork/
